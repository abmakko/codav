  <summary>Reads CODA SEPA payment XML files</summary>
  <description>
    <p>An "XML message for Credit Transfer Initiation" (ISO 20022 XML) file encodes European credit transfers (SEPA) in a standard way. It's often refered to as a "CODA (Coded Statement of Account) file". It requests the movement of funds from the debtor account to a creditor.</p>
    <p>CODAv is a desktop application that understands these electronic messages and serves as a viewer to verify the contents of these files. CODAv follows the <a href="https://www.febelfin.be/sites/default/files/files/standard-credit_transfer-xml-v31-en_0.pdf">Belgian implementation guidelines</a> as defined by the Belgian sector federation <a href="https://www.febelfin.be">Febelfin</a>.</p>
